Explanation: Upload a PDF of various poetry and let the model train on it, use a prompt, and allow the generation of poetry.

Libraries:

transformers: Provides pre-trained language models (like GPT-2) and utilities for fine-tuning.
datasets: Facilitates loading and processing of text data for training.
torch: The underlying deep learning framework for Transformers.
Model Setup:

Loads GPT-2 tokenizer and model (pre-trained on a large corpus of text).
Data Preparation:

load_pdf_data: Extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
build_text_dataset: Creates a dataset from the text for training.
Model Training:

Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the dataset derived from your PDF. This teaches the model the specific style and patterns of your poetry.
Poem Generation:

generate_poem: Uses the fine-tuned model to generate a new poem.
You can provide an optional prompt to guide the poem's theme or starting point.
max_length controls the maximum length of the generated poem.
How to Use:

Upload your PDF of poems in Colab.
Run the code. It will fine-tune GPT-2 on your poems.
A poem in the style of your PDF will be printed. Feel free to experiment with different prompts!
Key Improvements:

Uses GPT-2: A powerful language model known for generating creative text.
Fine-tuning: Adapts the model to your specific writing style.
Flexibility: Allows you to provide a prompt to guide the generated poem.
